# Sites
**V1.0**

An organization will create a site to advertise their events, credentials, etc. Learners will use the site to enroll for events, schedule assessments, share files and receive credentials. The organization's team will collaborate using the site. A site can have a shared domain name, eg. constoso.cloudtnt.com or a custom domain name, eg. learn.contoso.com managed by the organization.

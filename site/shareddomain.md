# Shared Domain
**V1.0**

A shared domain is the website URL for your site. You will use this URL to navigate to your [site](./create.md) in a web browser. The shared domain is fully managed by the application. The shared domain is a subdomain of ``cloudtnt.com`` which is a managed domain for the RCL Learn web application. An example for a shared domain is ``contoso.cloudtntnt.com``, where ``contoso`` is the **shared domain name**.

- In the ``Site > Shared Domain Name`` page, add a shared domain name, eg. ``contoso``. The name should only contain common letters, a-z. Special characters (eg: ,.?*-/&$) and numbers are not allowed. The name should contain 50 characters or less.

- It may take a few minutes to create the shared domain, so be patient.

- Once the shared domain is created, you can navigate to your [site](./create.md) using the URL displayed in the ``Shared Domain Name`` page.

- Note: You cannot have both a Shared Domain Name and a [Custom Domain Name](./customdomain.md) at the same time, one must be deleted.

{: .warning }
Multiple creation and deletion of a shared domain is an expensive compute operation and is not allowed. Your site may be disabled for this type of action.

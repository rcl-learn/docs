# Event Video
**V1.0**

In this section, you will learn about event videos. There are two event types based on the event video : **live video** and **recorded video**.

## Presenters

Presenters in an organization will set the link for live and recorded videos. The Organizer will assign a presenter to the event. The presenter will login to the presenter portal to set the video links for the event.

## Live Video

- Learners will attend the live event via a Microsoft Teams meeting. 

- The Presenter will set up a Microsoft Teams meeting in their Teams account. The Presenter will copy the Teams Meeting Link to paste in the RCL Learn application.

- In the **Presenter Portal**, in the **Events** page, click on the admin button on the far right for a selected event, then click the ``Video`` link.

- In the **Edit Event Video** page, add the Teams Meeting link and click the **Submit** button.


When setting up the meeting (event) on Microsoft Teams, ensure you ``Require unverified participants to verify their info before joining`` in the ``Meeting options``. In this way, you will check that the participant's email that they login to Microsoft Teams matches the username of the learner that enrolled for the event. This is important for paid events.

## Recorded Video

- The Presenter can upload videos to YouTube if this is a free event.

- The Presenter can also save a recorded video in their Microsoft OneDrive Account. This is applicable for paid events.

- This recorded video may be created from a saved Microsoft Teams meeting.

- Share Access to the video file on OneDrive will be provided to each of the learners that enrolled to the event.

- The Presenter will copy the video's Share Link to paste in the RCL Learn application.

- In the **Presenter Portal**, in the **Events** page, click on the admin button on the far right for a selected event, then click the ``Video`` link.

- In the **Edit Event Video** page, add the Share link for the video and click the **Submit** button.

## Using the Enrollment List

- On the **Enrollments** page, a Presenter can download a .csv file for all the learners enrolled for an event.

- The Presenter can use this list in the following ways:

    - Use the list to admit only enrolled learners in a Microsoft Teams meeting. This is important for paid events.

    - Use the list of usernames to set access to shared video files in Microsoft OneDrive so that only enrolled learners can play the video file. This is important for paid events.

    - Use the list to create a mail-merge in Microsoft Outlook to communicate with enrolled learners. This is useful to remind learners of a live event or inform them that a live event is about to start.
